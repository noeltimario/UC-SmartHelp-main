          UC SmartHelp is the University of Cebu's integrated helpdesk and AI-powered assistant platform,
          designed to help students get quick answers and connect with the right campus services anytime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our system allows students to chat with an AI chatbot for instant answers to common questions,
          submit helpdesk tickets to specific departments, and track their ticket status in real-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Staff members can manage and respond to tickets through their dashboard, while administrators
          have access to analytics, account management, and review insights across all departments.
